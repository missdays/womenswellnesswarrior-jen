# Women's wellness warriors

[Live Site](https://alcl2000.github.io/womenswellnesswarriors/)

Our app, 'Dot.' created for the CodeInstitute Women's Wellness hybrid hackathon

### Future Features

Due to time constraints, not all of our planned features could make into the final app. Had we had more time, these features could have been added to improve the app

#### Circle tracker 
- A circular tracker would have been implemented alongside the existing calender to make viewing the various phases of the menstrual cycle easier and more intuitive

### Bugs 

- Background colour
    - The background colour was too vivid and made text difficult to read
    - The chosen image selected for our background did not stretch efficiently and did not tesselate, a different image was chosen
- Git troubles
    - The repository was not initialised with a .gitignore file which meant that when necessary add ins were installed, all of the node packages were installed with them
-Circular tracker not tracking date
